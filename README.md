# zarinpalAPI
In this project I try to show, how to connect and pay using zaringpal api via ASP.net framework

In first section you need initial details about you product which you want to sell, such as 'Product Name', 'Product Desc', and 'Product Price', ...<br>
Then you should redirect tou Zarinpal gateway portal "https://www.zarinpal.com/pg/StartPay/"<br>
NOTE: it's important to correctly set callback url! otherwise first section can't go furture.<br>

In Second Section, You need to check status of transaction from zarinpal payment.

Goodluck :)
